Installation
============

The recommended way to install COMPAS is to use `Anaconda/conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`_

::

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
    $ conda install COMPAS


To verify your setup, start Python from the command line and run the following:

::

    >>> import compas
    >>> import compas_rhino
    >>> import compas_blender
    >>> import compas_ghpython


Updates
=======

COMPAS is still under very active development, with new versions being released
frequently. Updating your installation to the latest version is easy.

::

    $ conda update COMPAS

.. note::

    The ``update`` command doen't always work as expected.
    If you know to which version to upgrade, just do

    ::

        conda install COMPAS=0.7.0


.. _getting-started--virtual-environments:
Virtual environments
====================

One of the reasons to use virtual environments is to isolate dependencies, to
be able to create a fully reproducible setup, and to be able to work with
different versions of Python and/or different versions and combinations of
packages.

For example, if you work on a project that requires a specific version of Python or
a specific version of a package that is incompatible with the ones required by another
project, you can use environments to make sure both projects can run side-by-side
without constantly having to update your entire development setup.

Create an environment named "compas-dev".

::

    $ conda create -n compas-dev


Create an environment with a specific version of Python

::

    $ conda create -n compas-dev python=3.6


Install COMPAS (or other packages) for this environment

::

    $ conda install -n compas-dev COMPAS=0.6.2


For further instructions about managing virtual environments with conda
`see the docs <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_.

In any case, don't forget to activate the envirnment when you want to use the installed functionality.

::

    $ conda activate compas-dev

Known Issues
============

Plotter errors
--------------

**Problem** You get an error similar to the following when trying to run
anything involving a `Plotter` (or even just `matplotlib`)

**Solution** Install python.app

From https://matplotlib.org/faq/osx_framework.html:

The default python provided in (Ana)conda is not a framework build.
However, a framework build can easily be installed,
both in the main environment and in conda envs:
install python.app (``conda install python.app``)
and use ``pythonw`` rather than ``python``.

To install python.app when you create an environment do

::

    $ conda create -n compas-dev -c conda-forge python=3.7 python.app COMPAS


To install python.app in an already existing environment

::

    $ conda activate compas-dev
    $ conda install python.app
